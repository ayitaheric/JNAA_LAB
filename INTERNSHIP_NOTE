Seasons are regulated by Azos and St. Helena which are pressure systems.
ITCZ = An oceanic feature (circulate around the globe)
ITD  = A land feature (only perculiar to West Africa monsoon feature, it's a region of low pressure, high insolation)

                                               THE FOUR PRESSURE SYSTEMS
 1. Azores      = North Atlantic (Desert)
 2. St. Helena  = South Atlantic (Ocean)
 3. Siberian    = Europe ( brings about cold weather)
 4. Mascarene   = Near Madagascar
 
High pressure systems rotate clockwise in the northern hemisphere and anticlockwise in the southern hemisphere.
                                   WHAT CONSTITUTE TO THE MOVEMENT OF THE ITD
  1. THE Azores high pressure systems
  2. The St. Helena high pressure systems
  3. The Equatorial trough (Low Pressure system)
  4. The Midlatitude trough ( Low pressure system)
NB: It's named st. Helena because ther is an island called St. Helena in the ocean.  
NB: When the Azos and Saberian high pressure systems meet they bring cold and dry weather (Harmattan) 

                                                     24HRS FORECAST
Start your forecast from 12pm and take the readings at every 3 hours. The sudden change in the speed of the wind is the wind gust.The swirl movement of winds is a mesocscale feature. The mean temperature we experience in Kumasi is between 27 and 28 degree celcius.

NB:Every parameter, check from 12 to the next day 12. We check the RH with respect to temperature. RH and Temperature are inversly proportinal. When the temperature is high the system expands and RH is decreases. If the RH is high throughout means a lot of condensation take place hence rainfall.
After checking all the parameters, check the cloud type for example low, medium and high clouds to determine wether it'll rain or not. NB: Low level clouds are rain bearing clouds.Thunderstorm needs moisture to persist. We use the CAPE index to determine stable and unstable atmosphere. Stable atmosphere means there are low or no convective activity.

Very unstable        = 3500 J/Kg             = Extreemly severe lightning
Moderatelly unstable = 1000 - 2500 J/Kg      = Moderate lightning
Marginarlly unstable = less than 1000 J/Kg   = Marginar lightning
Stable               = 0 J/Kg(no convection) = No lightning 

NB:For low pressure systems, the lower their values the stronger they become but the for high pressure systems, the lower their values the weaker they becomes.

Thunderstorms and showers  are formed  from convection. Convection occurs when the air is unstable due to localised heating. The temperature at which latent heat is release during condensation is termed as Dewpoint temperature. Cumulus clouds are formed from convection because the dewpoint is fairly uniform over a wide area. The clouds will form at nearly the same height.

Qtn. Even quite large convective clouds will not give any rain because the up-draughts are too strong for even the larger drops to fall out. HOW?

NB:Differences in electric charge caused by the falling ice particles leads to the sparks flying. The electrical discharges can be cloud to ground, within a cloud or between clouds.  If the strike is within or behind a cloud, the light is diffused and is called SHEET LIGHTNING.

CAPE : Convective Available Potential Energy is a measure of the energy that can be realized if there is enough heating to give convection.The greater the energy that is released during convection, the greater will be the charge separation and the more lightning is liable to occur. NB:As ever in meteorology, little is ever simple or straightforward. Thunderstorms and lightning can also occur close to active weather fronts, especially cold fronts or occlusions.

                                                 THUNDERSTORM
There are four ingredients that must be present for a thundersttorm to occur
 1. Moisture
 2.instability
 3.Lifting
 4. Wind shear
NB:surface dewpoint needs to be 55 degrees Fahrenheit or greater for a surface based thunderstorm to occur.
